# Design a two-stage Miller op amp

Design a compensated, two-stage, single-ended CMOS op amp for a 1 pF load.

## Spec

- Provide `.subckt two_stage_miller_opamp vss iref vdd vinn vinp vout` with exactly this pin order. The testbench supplies a 50 µA reference current from `vdd` to `iref`; it uses 0.9 V input common mode and a 1 pF load from `vout` to `vss`.
- Across all 27 combinations of `tt`, `ff`, and `ss`; 1.62, 1.80, and 1.98 V; and -40, 27, and 125 °C, require at least 60 dB open-loop DC gain, 200 MHz unity-gain bandwidth, 60° phase margin, output error no greater than 25 mV from 0.9 V, total power no greater than 2 mW, and no more than 50 µVrms input-referred noise. The loop-gain magnitude must not return above 0 dB beyond the unity-gain crossing.
- Noise is measured in a noise-gain-20 closed loop from 10 Hz to that point's measured closed-loop -3 dB frequency.
- At representative `tt/1.80 V/27 °C`, `ss/1.62 V/125 °C`, and `ff/1.98 V/-40 °C` stresses, require moderate positive-supply rejection of at least 35 dB at 1 kHz and 1 MHz, CMRR of at least 55 dB at 1 kHz, and a contiguous unity-feedback output range of at least 0.8 Vpp whose closed-loop tracking error is at most 20 mV.
- At those same representative stresses, a 100 mV unity-follower step between 0.85 V and the explicit 0.95 V endpoint must settle within 20 ns, 2%, and 2 mV final error in both directions. A 0.65 V to 1.15 V unity-follower step must slew at least 50 V/µs in both directions.
- The design may use hierarchy and any electrical implementation consistent with the interface. Use Sky130 1.8 V core MOS devices plus positive ideal resistors and capacitors; do not put independent, controlled, or behavioral sources in the DUT. Read `SKY130_NETLIST_GUIDE.md` in the starter before editing the circuit.

Full signoff performs the complete 27-point gain/bandwidth/bias/power and noise matrices, plus the three stated representative dynamic and rejection stresses. Its informational report also includes `UGB × CL / IDD`, NEF, and PEF; these do not affect reward.

## Deliverable

Edit `/app/circuit.spi`. Public examples in `/app/testbench` show every measured analysis, print every scored scalar, and use the same interface and measurement definitions as signoff.

You can preflight the submitted netlist with `/opt/analog-arena/check_circuit.py /app/circuit.spi --allow-ideal R C`. The evaluator runs the same check whether or not you run it yourself.

This is an implementation task, not a repository-audit task.
Work in `/app` and modify only the declared deliverable; do not edit public development benches, model libraries, or external fixtures.
Make one bounded inspection pass over this instruction, the declared deliverable, supplied starter material, and public development benches.
As the task solver, create a runnable candidate in the file named in the Deliverable section before beginning detailed exploration, and keep that file updated as you work.
If your working time expires, the evaluator copies that file exactly as it exists at that moment and runs the verifier on it.
If the file is missing or empty, the result is zero reward.
Temporary files are not submitted.

Use supplied reference material and documented starter examples as the first source for syntax and interfaces.
If a concrete model, tool, or execution problem appears, investigate it as needed before continuing.
Iterate by editing the declared deliverable and using public development benches to diagnose observed behavior.
Do not repeatedly enumerate files, reread unchanged references, or retry unchanged discovery commands instead of editing and simulating.
