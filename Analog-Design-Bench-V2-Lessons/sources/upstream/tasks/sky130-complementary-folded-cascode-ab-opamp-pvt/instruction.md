# Design a complementary rail-to-rail Class-AB operational amplifier

Implement and verify the transistor-level complementary rail-to-rail, folded-cascode Class-AB operational amplifier described below. The starter contains the required interface and a placeholder; the submitted `circuit.spi` must contain the complete DUT.

## Spec

Use the 1.8 V SKY130 core models. The top-level interface provides a 20 µA reference-current port. The verifier evaluates all five process corners (`tt`, `ff`, `ss`, `fs`, and `sf`) at each of these five voltage-temperature stresses:

- 1.62 V at −40 °C
- 1.62 V at 125 °C
- 1.80 V at 27 °C
- 1.98 V at −40 °C
- 1.98 V at 125 °C

This is a declared representative 25-point PVT matrix: for each process corner it covers the nominal voltage-temperature point and the four corners of the supply-temperature box. It is not the complete 45-point Cartesian product of five process corners, three supplies, and three temperatures.

The named design target uses complementary NMOS/PMOS input paths, a folded-cascode current-summing stage, a floating-current-source Class-AB output stage, and series-RC Miller compensation. These functional stages define the task identity and design intent.

Any implementation that preserves the published interface, uses the permitted device vocabulary, and meets every electrical limit below is eligible. Device count, dimensions, internal node names, hierarchy, bias derivation, connectivity, and topology are not acceptance conditions. Ideal resistors and capacitors are permitted inside the DUT, including for source degeneration, damping, and compensation; the external load and all stimulus sources remain testbench elements.

The required top-level subcircuit is:

```spice
.subckt complementary_folded_cascode_ab_opamp vss iref vdd vinn vinp vout
* complete transistor-level implementation
.ends complementary_folded_cascode_ab_opamp
```

`vss`, `iref`, and `vdd` are the supply/bias ports. `vinn` and `vinp` are the differential inputs; `vout` is the single-ended output.

Use the published port interface and the supplied SKY130 model environment. The verifier accepts or rejects submitted circuits solely through finite electrical measurements; it does not inspect device names, topology, hierarchy, device counts, dimensions, or internal nodes. The 4 pF output load and all stimulus sources are testbench elements, not part of the DUT.

**Reproducible acceptance envelope.**

The following limits are the SKY130/ngspice sign-off contract used by the verifier. They are deliberately stated with the exact load, common-mode points, integration band, and PVT matrix so that another implementation cannot pass by exploiting an undefined measurement.

- With the specified 4 pF capacitive load, the AC bench uses DC-only level-shifted feedback to hold the output at `VDD/2` while independently sweeping input common mode; a 1 TΩ return to `VDD/2` prevents a floating output without materially loading it. At every published PVT point it evaluates `VCM = 0.1 V`, `0.2 V`, `VDD/2`, `VDD−0.2 V`, and `VDD−0.1 V`. Open-loop gain at 10 Hz is at least 90 dB at the three core-range points and at least 80 dB at the two 0.1 V near-rail points.
- Unity-loop UGB is at least 1 MHz at all five common-mode points. Phase margin is at least 60° at the three core-range points and at least 55° at the two near-rail points. The UGB maximum/minimum ratio over the complete PVT and common-mode AC matrix is at most 2.0. Missing gain, a missing unity crossing, a non-finite phase measurement, or an incomplete matrix fails closed. Closed-loop tracking and transient benches separately verify output swing and large-signal behavior; the AC test does not bias the output at a supply rail.
- With a 10 kΩ load to `VDD/2`, unity-gain tracking error is at most 20 mV from 0.1 V to VDD−0.1 V and at most 5 mV from 0.2 V to VDD−0.2 V. The measured input common-mode span is at least 1.5 V and reaches within 0.1 V of each rail.
- Static supply power, including the 20 µA reference branch, is at most 1.5 mW. The verifier checks both the mid-supply AC operating point and the maximum closed-loop power over an input sweep from 0 V to VDD at every published PVT point.
- A 0.2 V ↔ VDD−0.2 V unity-gain step drives 4 pF in parallel with 10 kΩ to `VDD/2`. Both slew rates must be at least 2 V/µs. During the final 100 ns of each 2 µs command plateau, the output must remain within 5 mV of the commanded level.
- Common-mode rejection, supply rejection, and distortion use the fixed absolute common-mode point `VCM = 0.9 V` at TT/1.80 V/27 °C, SS/1.62 V/125 °C, and FF/1.98 V/−40 °C. Common-mode rejection is at least 70 dB at 1 kHz and 55 dB at 1 MHz; supply rejection is at least 45 dB at 10 Hz and 10 dB at 1 MHz.
- Integrated unity-gain input-referred noise from 10 Hz to 1 MHz is at most 70 µVrms across all 25 PVT points at `VCM = VDD/2`, with 4 pF in parallel with 10 kΩ to `VDD/2`. At each of the three representative points above, a unity-gain 1 kHz, 0.4 V-peak sine centered at 0.9 V has Fourier THD at most 0.01% and a bounded distortion residual at most 0.5% of the command amplitude. Three deterministic `tt_mm` seeds at TT/1.80 V/27 °C and `VCM = VDD/2` must each have closed-loop offset no greater than 5 mV. These fixed seeds are regression coverage, not a statistical-yield claim.

The tracking, step, noise, distortion, and offset benches use 4 pF in parallel with 10 kΩ to `VDD/2`. The self-contained CMRR and PSRR benches use their published differential reference instances, 4 pF loads, and 100 MΩ DC returns. The noise band, signal amplitude, source impedance, load, and measurement definitions are fixed in the testbenches shipped with the task. Missing, non-finite, or incomplete PVT rows fail closed; a partial score is diagnostic only and is not a pass.

**Submission and verification.**

Edit only `circuit.spi` in the starter. Keep the required subcircuit name and pin order. Read `/opt/analog-arena/SKY130_NETLIST_GUIDE.md` before editing; it documents model wrappers, terminal order, geometry units, and hierarchy conventions. The verifier builds the environment and verifier contexts separately; runs the complete declared 25-point by five-common-mode AC matrix and complete 25-point tracking, step, and noise matrices; runs the three representative CMRR, PSRR, and distortion points plus three fixed mismatch seeds; and accepts only reward 1.0.

## Deliverable

Submit only the completed `/app/circuit.spi`, preserving the required subcircuit name and pin order.

You can preflight the submitted netlist with `/opt/analog-arena/check_circuit.py /app/circuit.spi --allow-ideal R C`. The evaluator runs the same check whether or not you run it yourself.

This is an implementation task, not a repository-audit task.
Work in `/app` and modify only the declared deliverable; do not edit public development benches, model libraries, or external fixtures.
Make one bounded inspection pass over this instruction, the declared deliverable, supplied starter material, and public development benches.
As the task solver, create a runnable candidate in the file named in the Deliverable section before beginning detailed exploration, and keep that file updated as you work.
If your working time expires, the evaluator copies that file exactly as it exists at that moment and runs the verifier on it.
If the file is missing or empty, the result is zero reward.
Temporary files are not submitted.

Use supplied reference material and documented starter examples as the first source for syntax and interfaces.
If a concrete model, tool, or execution problem appears, investigate it as needed before continuing.
Iterate by editing the declared deliverable and using public development benches to diagnose observed behavior.
Do not repeatedly enumerate files, reread unchanged references, or retry unchanged discovery commands instead of editing and simulating.
